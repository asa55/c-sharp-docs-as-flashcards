##

C# (pronounced "See Sharp") is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe

%

programming language

##

C# enables developers to build many types of secure and robust applications that run in

%

.NET

##

C# has its roots in the C family of languages and will be immediately familiar to `_____`, `_____`, `_____`, and `_____` programmers.

%

C# has its roots in the C family of languages and will be immediately familiar to **C**, **C++**, **Java**, and **JavaScript** programmers.

##

C# is an object-oriented, component-oriented

%

programming language

##

C# provides language constructs to directly support object oriented and component oriented concepts, making C# a natural language in which to create and use

%

software components

##

Since its origin, C# has added features to support new workloads and emerging software

%

design practices

##

At its core, C# is an object-oriented language. You define types and their

%

behavior

##

Several C# features help create robust and durable applications:

- `_____`
- `_____`
- `_____`
- `_____`
- `_____`
- `_____`

%

- Garbage collection
  - automatically reclaims memory occupied by unreachable unused objects
- Nullable types
  - guard against variables that don't refer to allocated objects
- Exception handling
  - provides a structured and extensible approach to error detection and recovery
- Lambda expressions
  - support functional programming techniques
- Language Integrated Query (LINQ) syntax
  - creates a common pattern for working with data from any source
- Language support for asynchronous operations
  - provides syntax for building distributed systems

##

C# has a unified type system. All C# types, including primitive types such as int and double, inherit from a single root

%

object type

##

All C# types share a set of common operations. Values of any type can be stored, transported, and operated upon in a

%

consistent manner

##

C# supports both user-defined reference types and

%

value types

##

C# allows `_____` allocation of objects and in-line storage of lightweight structures.

%

C# allows **dynamic** allocation of objects and in-line storage of lightweight structures.

##

C# supports `_____` methods and types, which provide increased type safety and performance.

%

C# supports **generic** methods and types, which provide increased type safety and performance.

##

C# provides `_____`, which enable implementers of collection classes to define custom behaviors for client code.

%

C# provides **iterators**, which enable implementers of collection classes to define custom behaviors for client code.

##

C# emphasizes `_____` to ensure programs and libraries can evolve over time in a compatible manner.

%

C# emphasizes **versioning** to ensure programs and libraries can evolve over time in a compatible manner.

##

Aspects of C#'s design that were directly influenced by versioning considerations include

- `_____`
- `_____`
- `_____`

%

- the separate virtual and override modifiers
- the rules for method overload resolution
- and support for explicit interface member declarations
